# Sales-Dashboard


## Problem Statement

This dashboard helps the company to understand their sales better. This dashboard will give a feel of how data analysis projects are executed in big companies. Case study is based on a computer hardware business which is facing challenges in dynamically changing market. Here I build a Tableau dashboard that gives us a real time sales insights of a company.

In this project, I will analyze and transform data, and create interactive visualizations, reports, and dashboards by using Tableau Desktop.
Here I chose sales data of a random company for analysis and visualization. The Quere editing was done in 'MySQL server' and visualization part was done using 'Tableau Desktop'.
From the "sales" database, the following tables were chosen for analysis:

- customers.sql 
- date.sql
- markets.sql
- products.sql
- transactions.sql

#### Query Editing Tool: "MySQL"
#### Visualization Tool: "Tableau Desktop"
